# About me☝️

Hi, I’m Jorge Tejera
I am studying "DAW" first,
which is a higher degree professional training in web application development.
I am from Gran Canaria in Canary Islands, Spain.
I am interested in Developing and IT in general.

# Studies 🗒️
In this first year we learn for example:

* Java.
* HTML and CSS.
* We work with agile methodologies.
* Git.
* XML.
* MySQL.
  
Before that, I was studying mid-level vocational training in systems and networks where for example, I learn about:
 * Linux and Windows (client and server)
 * Hardware maintenance
 * Network configurations
 * I bit of cibersecurity
   
That was two year, and we finish with practices in a enterprise. After I finish that, I decide to join learning web developing.

**I would like to continue learning more every day and continue training as a developer.**
